Classification of Zalando's fashion article images

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is meant to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

“Fashion MNIST” dataset is used for experimenting and practicing machine learning. The dataset is provided by Zalando(https://zalando.com/) . Thanks to Zalando Research(https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) for hosting the dataset.
